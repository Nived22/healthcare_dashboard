# 🧠 Healthcare Analytics Dashboard

This project is a **Healthcare Analytics Dashboard** built using **Python, Streamlit, and Machine Learning**. It allows users to analyze diabetes-related data and predict the risk of diabetes using a Random Forest classifier.

## 📌 Features

* 📊 Interactive data visualization using Plotly
* 🤖 Diabetes risk prediction using Random Forest ML model
* 🎛️ User input via sliders for real-time predictions
* 🧹 Clean and modular code with Streamlit UI
* 🧠 Works with the Pima Indians Diabetes Dataset

## 🧪 Dataset

* **Name**: Pima Indians Diabetes Database
* **Source**: [Kaggle](https://www.kaggle.com/datasets/uciml/pima-indians-diabetes-database)
* **Description**: Contains diagnostic measurements of female patients for predicting the onset of diabetes.

---

## 📈 Visualizations

* Histogram of Age vs Outcome
* Sidebar sliders for custom user health metrics
* Real-time diabetes risk prediction

---

## 🧠 Machine Learning Model

* **Algorithm**: Random Forest Classifier
* **Target**: `Outcome` (0 = No diabetes, 1 = Diabetes)
* **Libraries**: Scikit-learn, Pandas

---

## 📌 Future Improvements

* Add accuracy metrics and confusion matrix
* Deploy on Streamlit Cloud or Heroku
* Extend to include heart disease or cancer risk datasets
